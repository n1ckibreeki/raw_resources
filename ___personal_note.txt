- 18th November 2025
I kept thinking and thinking what i should do next after my university graduration, One day i was thinking of like if i gradurated i will quit roblox and start focus on something and start to work and start making family at the age of 25
and another thought thinking of like what will my friend will thinking of me if i suddently disappeared off-line both Discord, Facebook, Twitter and ROBLOX account, Will they thinking that i was dead?
but if i tell them like "oh i was thinking of quit roblox and social, you'll no longer see me now" you thinking that they going to care about it? i don't think that they'll care about it because every message that i sent to my friend talk about miscs stuff, they don't even cares about me.
i guess i shouldn't thinking like that maybe they'll reply me one day..  one day.. i hope it is one day..  they'll started to talk with me.. like how they're started to talk with my like how they did first time see me.
